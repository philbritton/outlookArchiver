outlookArchiver
===============

Does archiving jobs in your outlook inbox. Cleans your inbox from attachments and saves it to hard disk. 
I wrote this little script to manage my company's mail inbox whose size is limited to 100mb. It is a bit tedious to
remove all attachments manually and put them on to hard disk. 
This script creates a folder for each sender and puts all attachments in it.
